\begin{abstract}
\vspace{-.7cm}
Due to recent advances in Domain Specific Language (DSL) workbenches, it has
become possible to build model-driven development environments as sets of
individual DSLs that get composed for a specific purpose.
In this paper we explore how model-driven development environments can
become process-aware, to assist the user when building a model.
We offer an explanation to our ideas at three levels of abstraction:
1) the \emph{meta-meta} level, the Meta-Programming System (MPS) workbench with
its language definition capibilities; 2) the \emph{meta} level, where brick DSLs
are defined and assembled into frameworks that are further tailored for
particular modelling scenarios through the introduction of an explicit process for model construction; and 3) the \emph{model} level, where
models are built through progressive tool-guided refinements and automated
steps based on the process introduced at the \emph{meta} level.
We exemplify our approach by providing the main highlights of the ongoing
development of a model-driven requirements gathering environment for our
industrial partners.

% The levels of abstr are illustrated: the individual brick languages for
% gathering requirements; how these DSLs are composed and organised to 
% fulfill our partner's requirements gathering process; and an example of using
% the system to build
