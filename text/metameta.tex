\section{The \emph{metameta} Level: MPS: A Language Meta-Editor}
\label{sec:metameta}
\vspace{-.3cm}
The metameta level (M3, in MOF terms) is where the bricks for our approach are
built. These bricks consist of DSLs, defined in the MPS (Meta Programming
System)~\cite{mps} framework. MPS is a stable and industrially-proven
projectional meta-editor which provides editing capabilities at the meta-levels
needed for our approach: M2 and M1. It uniformly integrates language and editor
design capabilities, together with code generation tools and in-built
correct-by-construction techniques such as meta-model conformance, syntax
highlighting, auto-completion or type checking.
MPS is developed by JetBrains, which assumes the role of \emph{framework
developer}.
Throughout this paper we will often use vocabulary that is close to that used in
the MPS world in order to remain aligned with the technical aspects of our
work. In particular, the following terms are recurrently used in what follows:
\vspace{-.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Language}: an MPS language includes a metamodel, in the classical
  EMF sense. It additionally includes one or more editors for its metamodel,
  which provide concrete syntax.
  \item \emph{Concept}: the MPS equivalent of metamodel class.
  \item \emph{Concept / language instance}: concepts can be instantiated, in
  the same way metamodel classes can. We will also sometimes write
  \emph{language instance} to refer to an instance of the \emph{root} concept of
  an MPS language.
  \item \emph{Intentions}: actions attached to
  concepts of a language, available to the user. 
%   Those actions can be launched by the user when the
%   focus of the editor is on objects which are instances of those concepts.
  \item \emph{Language composition}:  Reference or containment relations can exist between instances of
  concepts of different languages, which is the primary language composition
  mechanism in MPS.
 Another composition mechanism is the MPS model, which can contain instances of
 concepts belonging to many languages.
 %which  provides an additional means for language composition.
\end{itemize}

% At this level we had to extend the existing MPS framework with languages to
% define \emph{flow} and a \emph{dashboard}. Additionally, we have provided
% extension points to give the user the possibility to define her own constraints
% that can be used to direct the flow of edition of the composed model.
