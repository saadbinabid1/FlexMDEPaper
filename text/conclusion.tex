We have presented a technique for the construction of
domain-specific model editors in MPS, where these editors are based on
a set of composed DSLs and on a description of the process that
should be followed when building the models for that domain. We have applied our
approach to the construction of an editor for gathering software requirements
at two meta-levels: firstly, we build an abstract requirements gathering
framework, following the guidelines in the MIRA framework~\cite{MIRA13}; secondly, we
specialize that framework for our industrial partners at Diehl, by introducing
a specific requirements refinement process for controllers for cooling systems.

The main technical contribution of this paper are the means to define a process
to assist in building a model in a domain-specific model-driven development
environment. This process is based on a set of automated model analyses and can
guide the user until the model is complete.
At a methodological level, our contribution regards our ideas on the separation
of the \emph{framework customizer} and the  \emph{domain specific tool
developer} roles. While the former is responsible for defining a number of
fundamental ``brick'' DSLs, the latter further specializes them for a particular
application by adding more languages and organizing the whole according to a
process.

In its current state, the main shortcoming of the technique we propose in this
paper is the fact that it is the complete responsibility of the domain-specific
tool developer to check the consistency of the properties being checked during
the unfolding of the process, as well as their logical sequence in the process.
Although we have gathered some information about process construction through
the two case-studies
at~\cite{coolingControllerProcessVideo,earsctrlProcessVideo}, it is necessary to
model larger processes to better understand the advantages and disadvantages of
our proposal.  Scalability is also an issue as analyses currently
run very often in the background, which will rapidly lead to performance
degradation in larger systems. Potential solutions to this problem are currently
being investigated by colleagues of our at fortiss~\cite{Models17Sudeep}.

As future work, beyond mitigating the shortcomings above, we will continue
working with Diehl Aerospace to develop the case study we present in this paper
into a usable requirements gathering system. Other partner companies have shown
interest in applying our work domains other than requirements engineering, which
points to building or assembling different language stacks as well as different
processes.
